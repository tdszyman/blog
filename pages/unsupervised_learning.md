Unsupervised learning is one of the major, broad categories of machine learning. The primary characteristic of an unsupervised machine learning problem is that the data used as in input to the machine learning algorithm is 
[unlabeled](/unlabeled_data.html). This contrasts with [supervised learning](/supervised_learning.html) in which the input data is [labeled](/labeled_data.html).

The most common example of unsupervised learning is [clustering](/clustering.html). Another common use case is [representation learning](/representation_learning.html), for example learning vector [embeddings](/embeddings.html) with a neural network [autoencoder](/autoencoder.html).
