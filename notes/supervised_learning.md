Supervised learning is one of the major, broad categories of machine learning. The primary characteristic of a supervised machine learning problem is that the data used as in input to the machine learning algorithm is 
[labeled](unlabeled_data). This contrasts with [unsupervised learning](unsupervised_learning) in which the input data is [unlabeled](unlabeled_data).

Common supervised machine learning methods include [classification](classification) and [regression](regression).
