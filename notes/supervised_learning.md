Supervised learning is one of the major, broad categories of machine learning. The primary characteristic of a supervised machine learning problem is that the data used as in input to the machine learning algorithm is 
[labeled](/blog/notes/unlabeled_data). This contrasts with [unsupervised learning](/blog/notes/unsupervised_learning) in which the input data is [unlabeled](/blog/notes/unlabeled_data).

Common supervised machine learning methods include [classification] and [regression].
