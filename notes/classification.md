Classification is one of the most commonly used techniques in [supervised](supervised_learning) machine learning. In classification, each example in the data set is assigned to exactly one class from a set of known classes. Training a classification algorithm requires [labeled](labeled_data) training data. If labeled data is unavailable, then an [unsupervised](unsupervised_learning) [clustering](clustering) algorithm may be used instead.

## Types of classification problems:

* Binary classification
* Multi-class classification
* Sequence labeling
* Ordinal classification

## Algorithms for classification

* [Logisitic regression](logistic_regression)
* [Support Vector Machines](support_vector_machines)
* [K-nearest-neighbors](k_nearest_neighbors)
* [Deep learning](deep_learning)
