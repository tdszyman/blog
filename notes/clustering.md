Clustering is an [unsupervised](unsupervised_learning) machine learning technique for inferring some kind of structure over a set of input data points. A clustering algorithm partitions the input data set into $k$ partitions called clusters. The parameter $k$, the number of clusters, is typically provided as a [hyperparameter], but in some algorithms it may be set dynamically. Each data point in the input is assigned by the algorithm to one of the $k$ clusters. The general utility of clustering lies in the assumption that the data naturally belong to different classes, but the labels for these classes are unobserved. Therefore setting the parameter $k$ accurately is often an important consideration for getting good results from clustering.

When the cluster labels are known, the analogous [supervised] approach to this same problem is called [classification].
